# App Planning Activity

## Planning a simple app

Think back to the [Veterinarian API](./veterinarian-api-description.md) - use this app description as a reference to plan a new version of this app.

- Create the user stories that align with the resources in the API and then put them into a new Trello board (you can delete this board once it has been graded)

Submit a link to your Trello board on Canvas.
